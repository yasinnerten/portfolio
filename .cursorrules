Now we will create a we b page contains my portfolio.

Here is structure to build the page:
## 🏗 **Project Structure**

### **Frontend (Next.js with Tailwind CSS)**

```
/portfolio-frontend
│── public/                 # Static assets (Images, Icons, Fonts)
│── src/
│   ├── assets/             # Additional images and icons
│   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── app/                # Next.js app router pages
│   │   ├── page.tsx        # Home Page
│   │   ├── about/page.tsx  # About Me
│   │   ├── projects/page.tsx # Projects Page
│   │   ├── experience/page.tsx # Experience Page
│   │   ├── contact/page.tsx # Contact Page
│   │   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout
│   ├── styles/             # Global styles (Tailwind)
│   ├── services/           # API calls (Axios)
│── next.config.js          # Next.js Config
│── package.json            # Dependencies
│── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript Config
│── tailwind.config.js      # Tailwind Config
│── Dockerfile              # Docker containerization
```

### **Backend (Go + Gin + SQLite)**
lets continue with Building the backend with Go, Gin, and SQLite
```
/portfolio-backend
│── main.go                  # Entry point
│── config/                  # Config files
│── controllers/             # API controllers
│── routes/                  # Route definitions
│── models/                  # Database models (SQLite)
│── database/                # SQLite connection
│── middleware/              # Middleware (auth, logging)
│── static/                  # Stores uploaded images (if needed)
│── Dockerfile               # Docker containerization
│── go.mod                   # Go module dependencies
│── docker-compose.yml       # Container orchestration
```

## **🛠 Steps to Deploy on AWS Free Tier**
1. Install Docker & AWS CLI on your EC2 instance.
2. Clone your GitHub repository.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to deploy the services.
4. Use **AWS Route 53** or **Elastic IP** to configure a domain.

This setup provides a **lightweight, SQLite-based** solution for your portfolio. Images should be placed in `public/` or `src/assets/` for frontend and `static/` for backend if needed. Let me know if you need further modifications! 🚀

This setup provides a **scalable**, **containerized** solution for your portfolio. Let me know if you need any modifications! 🚀
